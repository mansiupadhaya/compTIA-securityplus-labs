# CompTIA Security+ Labs
This repository contains writeups and summaries of hands-on labs aligned with the CompTIA Security+ certification objectives. Each lab is focused on building real-world security skills through guided exercises in controlled environments.

## About This Repo
These writeups are part of a learning approach to reinforce key Security+ concepts through practical labs. Rather than listing every click and command, each writeup emphasises the understanding, process and analysis. 

## Lab Structure
Each lab includes: 
* Objectives
* Key concepts & Theory
* Step-by-Step Hands-On Exercises
* Screenshots (where applicable)
* Analysis & Reflection
* Security Implications
* Final Thoughts & Key Takeaways

## Prerequisites 
* Basic knowledge of Windows and command-line tools (PowerShell, cmd)
* Familiarity with virtual machines and isolated lab environments
* A foundational understanding of networking and security principles
* A controlled environment to safely replicate labs if desired (for example, local VMs or an approved sandbox environment)

## Note
These labs are designed for educational purposes within controlled, vulnerable environments. Always follow responsible disclosure practices and only test on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore the labs, learning along, and fork if you find the structure useful for your own notes
